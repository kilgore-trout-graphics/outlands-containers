### Outlands Container Graphics

Here are some replacement graphics for your container umps in Ultima Online Outlands.

#### Installation

1. Navigate to https://github.com/snydercreative/outlands-graphics (You may already be here).
1. Click the green "Code" button, and select "Download ZIP".
1. Extract the ZIP file to a new folder. You'll need the files inside this folder in a few steps.
1. Navigate to your root Outlands folder; for example, mine's at "c:\Program Files (x86)\Ultima Online Outlands", but yours may be different.
1. If you do not have a GumpOverrides folder, create one in your root Outlands folder.
1. In the ZIP you downloaded, you'll find a folder for the year, and inside that are the folders with the gump graphics files. For example, the Basic collection images are available in /2024/Basic.
1. Copy the files you want to use from the folder (and not the folder itself) from step 2 into the GumpOverrides folder.
1. Load your client and check out your new bags!

Just delete the files from GumpOverrides if you want to restore the original bag graphics.

Note: These work better when you have hued containers off (Options > Interface > Match Container Gump Hue Mode: Off).

If you have any questions contact Kilgore Trout on the UO Outlands discord.
