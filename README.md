### Outlands Container Graphics

These work better when you have hued containers off (Options > Interface > Match Container Gump Hue Mode).

#### Here's how to use them

1. Download the ZIP file full of bag graphics.
2. Extract the ZIP file to a new folder. You'll need the files inside this folder in a few steps.
3. Navigate to your root Outlands folder; for example, mine's at "c:\Program Files (x86)\Ultima Online Outlands", but yours may be different.
4. If you do not have a GumpOverrides folder, create one in your root Outlands folder.
5. Copy the files (not the folder) from step 2 into the GumpOverrides folder.
6. Load your client and check out your new bags!

Just delete the files from GumpOverrides if you want to restore the original bag graphics.

If you have any questions contact Kilgore Trout on the UO Outlands discord.
