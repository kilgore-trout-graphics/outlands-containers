## Outlands Container Graphics

Here are some replacement graphics for your container gumps in Ultima Online Outlands.

### Installation

1. Navigate to https://github.com/kilgore-trout-graphics/outlands-containers/releases (You may already be here).
2. Download the `Source code (zip)` file from the bottom of the latest release.
3. Extract the ZIP file to a new folder. You'll need the files inside this folder in a few steps.
4. Navigate to your root Outlands folder; for example, mine's at "c:\Program Files (x86)\Ultima Online Outlands", but yours may be different.
5. If you do not have a GumpOverrides folder, create one in your root Outlands folder.
6. In the ZIP you downloaded, you'll find a folder for the year, and inside that are the folders with the gump graphics files. For example, the Basic collection images are available in /2024/Basic.
7. Copy the files you want to use from the folder (and not the folder itself) from step 2 into the GumpOverrides folder.
8. Load your client and check out your new bags!

Just delete the files from GumpOverrides if you want to restore the original bag graphics.

Note: These work better when you have hued containers off (Options > Interface > Match Container Gump Hue Mode: Off).
